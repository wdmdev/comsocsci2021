    "# Part 2: r/wallstreetbets authors lifespan\n",
    "> Consider the _comments dataset_ including comments posted on r/wallstreetbets in reply to submissions about Gamestop. \n",
    "> 1. For each author, find the time of publication of their first comment, _min_time_, and the time of publication of their last comment, _max_time_, in [unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/). \n",
    "> 2. Compute the \"lifespan\" of authors as the difference between _max_time_ and _min_time_. Note that timestamps are measured in seconds, but it is appropriate here to compute the lifespan in days. Make a histogram showing the distribution of lifespans, choosing appropriate binning. What do you observe?\n",
    "> 3. Now, we will look at how many authors joined and abandoned the discussion on GME over time. First, use the numpy function [numpy.histogram2d](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html) to create a 2-dimensional histogram for the two variables _min_time_ and _max_time_. A 2D histogram, is nothing but a histogram where bins have two dimensions, as we look simultaneously at two variables. You need to specify two arrays of bins, one for the x-axis and the other for the y-axis. Pick bins with length 1 week.\n",
    "> 4. Now, use the matplotlib function [``plt.imshow``](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) to visualize the 2d histogram. You can follow [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set) on StackOverflow. To show dates instead of unix timestamps in the x and y axes, use [``mdates.date2num``](https://matplotlib.org/api/dates_api.html#matplotlib.dates.date2num). More details in this [StackOverflow example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23139595/dates-in-the-xaxis-for-a-matplotlib-plot-with-imshow), see accepted answer.\n",
    "> 5. Make sure that the colormap allows to well interpret the data, by passing ``norm=mpl.colors.LogNorm()`` as an argument to imshow. This will ensure that your colormap is log-scaled. Add a [colorbar](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/color/colorbar_basics.html) on the side of the figure, with the appropriate [colorbar label](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/colorbar_api.html#matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_label).\n",
    "> 6. Look at the figure, and write down three key observations."
